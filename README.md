 <h1>Description</h1>
 <p> 
 A basic hand eye coordination game is played by matching the arrows displayed on the screen from left to right ,to the arrows pressed on the keyboard. 
 The spacebar is only allowed to be pressed once all 8 arrows have a green border around them and it will generate the next set of 8 arrows.
 Once the start button is clicked, there will be a countdown of 3 seconds before the first 8 arrows appear. Players will have 30 seconds to try and complete
 as many arrows.
